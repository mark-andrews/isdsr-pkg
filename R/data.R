#' @title YouGov 2017 Poll of Illegal Drug Use
#' @description Data concerning the question "Have you ever taken an illegal
#'   drug?" that was in a 2017 poll of 1300 British young adults. Individual
#'   respondents' data are not available but respondents were grouped into
#'   various demographic groups, including age group and gender. Here, we report
#'   the number of respondents in each combination of gender and age group who
#'   gave each of the 8 possible responses to the question.
#' @name yougov17drugs
#' @format A data frame with 48 rows and 4 variables: 
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{gender}}{(factor) Respondents' gender (male/female)}
#'   \item{\code{age}}{(ordinal) Age group (16-18, 19-21, 22-24)}
#'   \item{\code{response}}{(factor) Each possible response to the question
#'   "Have you ever taken an illegal drug". There were 8 possible responses: 1) "I
#'   have taken illegal drugs frequently and still do", 2) "I have taken illegal
#'   drugs frequently but have now stopped completely", 3) "I have taken illegal
#'   drugs occasionally and still do", 4) "I have taken illegal drugs occasionally
#'   but have now stopped completely", 5) "I have only taken illegal drugs once or
#'   twice", 6) "Iâ€™ve never taken any illegal drugs", 7) "Not sure", 8) "Prefer not to
#'   say".} 
#'   \item{\code{count}}{(numeric) The number of respondents who gave each
#'   particular response to the question.}
#'   }
#' @details The poll in which this question occurred was conducted between the
#'   27th June and the 5th July 2017. A total of 1300 young adults were
#'   surveyed, all of whom were residents of the Britain (England, Wales, or
#'   Scotland), and whose ages ranged from 16 to 24. The individual respondent
#'   level data were not made available. However, the number of individuals in
#'   various demographic categories, including age, gender, etc., were provided.
#'   In addition, the percentage of individuals in each category that chose each
#'   possible response to the question was provided. For example, the report of
#'   the poll results states that there were 162 males in the 16-18 age group.
#'   It also states that 12% of respondents in this male 16-18 group responded
#'   to the question with "I have taken illegal drugs occasionally and still
#'   do". If we assume that this entails that 12% of the 162 individuals in this
#'   group responded in this way, then this is approximately 19 individuals in
#'   this gender and age group who responded this way. It should be noted,
#'   however, that it is not obvious that the count of the number of individuals
#'   in each group who responded in any given way can be obtained simply by
#'   multiplying the reported percentage by the reported total, as we have just
#'   done. The percentages may have been calculated using some weighting
#'   formula. Although it is not explicitly stated that this was done, the
#'   report does provide unweighted as well as weighted totals in each
#'   demographic category, and thus it may be that some weighting was applied to
#'   obtain the reported percentage. Notwithstanding this possibility, here we
#'   report counts for each category and response type obtaining by simply
#'   multiplying the stated unweighted total for each category by the stated
#'   percentage for each possible response.
