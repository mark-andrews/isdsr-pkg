\title{Install the packages listed in sgsur's \emph{Suggests}}
\usage{
install_extras()
}
\value{
Called for its side effect of installing packages; invisibly returns
the character vector of packages that were requested for installation.
}
\description{
The core functionality of sgsur works after you install the package
itself and any packages in its \emph{Imports} field.
However, throughout the accompanying textbook, we will use some packages
that are not \emph{Imports} dependencies.
These are not required for sgsur code to work, but are used or are recommended
in the book.
This function installs all these extra packages.
}
\details{
\code{install_extras()} checks which of those suggested packages are not
currently installed and installs just the missing ones.  Dependencies of
each extra package (their own \emph{Depends}, \emph{Imports}, and \emph{LinkingTo})
are handled automatically by \code{\link[utils]{install.packages}}.

The function never installs packages silently: it prints the list of names
it is about to install, or a friendly message if everything is already
present.
