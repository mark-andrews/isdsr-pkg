\title{NHANES: Depressed Mood, Sleep, and Work (Adults 18+)}
\format{
A tibble with 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{Depressed}{Ordered factor with levels
\code{None < Several < Most}, indicating how often in the past 30 days
the participant felt down, depressed, or hopeless (asked of ages 18+).}
\item{SleepHrsNight}{Self-reported number of hours usually slept at night
on weekdays/workdays (asked of ages 16+).}
\item{Work}{Employment status, a factor with levels \code{NotWorking},
\code{Working}.}
}

\description{
A small subset of \pkg{NHANES} focusing on self-reported depressed mood,
usual sleep duration, and employment status for participants aged 18 and over.
Rows are participants from the resampled NHANES 2009–2012 teaching dataset.
}
\details{
Derived from \code{NHANES::NHANES} by filtering to adults (\code{Age >= 18}),
retaining \code{Depressed}, \code{SleepHrsNight}, and \code{Work},
ordering the \code{Depressed} levels as \code{None < Several < Most}, and
restricting \code{Work} to \code{NotWorking}/\code{Working}.

The \code{NHANES} dataset in the \pkg{NHANES} package is a resampled
teaching version of the original complex-survey data and can be treated,
for educational purposes, as if it were a simple random sample.
See the NHANES documentation for caveats about weighting and design.
