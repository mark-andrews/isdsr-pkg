\description{
A small longitudinal data set ( \emph{n} = 100) that tracks perceived stress before
and after completion of a 6-week online mindfulness course.
Each participant completed the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; range
0–40, higher = more stress) three times:
\itemize{
\item immediately before starting the course,
\item immediately after finishing the course,
\item one month later.
Gender was recorded at enrolment; no other personal identifiers are present.

\details{
The data originate from Krusche \emph{et al.} (2012),
“Mindfulness online: a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of a
web-based mindfulness course and the impact on stress,” \emph{BMJ Open} 2:e000803.
Participants self-referred to the course and
completed the PSS online.
In the published paper the authors report a significant reduction in stress
from baseline to post-course that remained stable at follow-up.
The original data XLSX file was downloaded from the Dryad repository (DOI
10.5061/dryad.f4688) on 29 June 2025 and lightly cleaned: only the columns
shown above were kept, names were standardised, and an \code{id} column was
added.
