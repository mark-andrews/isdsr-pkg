\title{Variance inflation factors (tidy output)}
\usage{
vif(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{"lm"}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per model term and two numeric columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{term}}{the name of the predictor or interaction term}
\item{\code{vif}}{the corresponding variance inflation factor}
}
}
\description{
Computes variance inflation factors (VIFs) for every term in an ordinary
leastâ€“squares model and returns the results as a two-column tibble.
}
\details{
Internally the function calls \code{\link[car]{vif}} and tidies the numeric
vector it produces with \code{\link[tibble]{enframe}}.
A VIF measures how much the sampling variance of a regression coefficient is
inflated by collinearity among the predictors.
Rules of thumb often flag values above 5 or 10 as potential problems,
but appropriate cut-offs depend on sample size and study goals.

\examples{
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + disp, data = mtcars)
