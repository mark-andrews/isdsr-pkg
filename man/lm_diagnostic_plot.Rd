\item{model}{An \code{lm} object.}

\item{type}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"resid"} — residuals vs fitted (with a loess smooth).
\item \code{"qq"} — Q–Q plot of standardised residuals with reference line.
\item \code{"scale"} — scale–location plot \eqn{\sqrt{|r_i|}}{sqrt(|r_i|)} vs fitted.
\item \code{"lev"} — standardised residuals vs leverage, with reference lines;
point size indicates Cook’s distance.

\description{
Produce one of four standard diagnostic plots for a fitted \code{lm} model
using \pkg{ggplot2} layers and \pkg{broom}’s augmented data.
These plots help check the core assumptions of the normal linear model:
a linear conditional mean, errors centred at zero, roughly constant variance,
and error distributions close enough to normal for small‑sample \eqn{t}-based inference.
}
\details{
The function draws one of four plots, selected via \code{type}.

\strong{1) \code{type = "resid"} — Residuals vs fitted}

Raw residuals \eqn{\hat\varepsilon_i = y_i - \hat y_i} versus fitted values \eqn{\hat y_i}.
A well‑specified model shows a roughly horizontal band around 0 with no systematic pattern.

\emph{What to look for}
\itemize{
\item \emph{Linearity:} Curvature (e.g., U‑shape) suggests the conditional mean is not linear in \eqn{x}.
Consider transforming a variable or changing the mean function.
\item \emph{Constant variance:} A funnel pattern—residual spread growing or shrinking with the fitted values—
indicates heteroskedasticity. Consequences include misleading standard errors and p‑values.
Remedies include variance‑stabilising transforms (e.g., logs), modelling the variance,
or reporting heteroskedasticity‑robust standard errors (which do not change \eqn{\hat\beta}, only the uncertainty).
\item \emph{Outliers:} Points far from 0 vertically (large residuals) may indicate outliers or data issues.
\item \emph{Structure / clustering:} Stripes or clusters can signal omitted groups, time dependence,
or different variances by subgroup.
}

\strong{2) \code{type = "qq"} — Normal Q–Q of standardised residuals}

Ordered standardised residuals against theoretical normal quantiles with a reference line.
Points should lie close to the line for approximate normality of errors.
Departures in both tails indicate heavy tails; an S‑shape indicates skewness.

\emph{What to look for}
\itemize{
\item \emph{Heavy tails:} Points bending away from the line at both ends
(above in the upper tail, below in the lower tail) imply heavier tails than normal.
\item \emph{Skewness:} A systematic S‑shape (one tail above, the other below) indicates skew.
Transformations of the outcome may help.
\item \emph{Isolated extremes:} A few points far from the line are candidate outliers; investigate their influence.
}

\strong{3) \code{type = "scale"} — Scale–location}

Plots \eqn{\sqrt{|r_i|}}{sqrt(|r_i|)} versus fitted values, where \eqn{r_i} are standardised residuals.
This stabilises the spread and makes trends in residual variability easier to see.
A flat band supports constant variance; upward or downward trends suggest heteroskedasticity.

\emph{What to look for}
\itemize{
\item \emph{Flat band:} Supports the constant‑variance assumption.
\item \emph{Upward trend:} Variance increases with the mean—intervals may be too narrow at large fitted values.
\item \emph{Downward trend:} Variance decreases with the mean—intervals may be too wide at small fitted values.
}

\strong{4) \code{type = "lev"} — Standardised residuals vs leverage}

Standardised residuals (\code{.std.resid}) versus leverage (\code{.hat}).
Points far to the right have high leverage (unusual \eqn{x} values).
Points far up or down have large residuals.
Large influence typically arises when \emph{both} leverage and residual are large.
A vertical reference line is drawn at \eqn{2p/n}, where \eqn{p} is the number of
model coefficients (including the intercept) and \eqn{n} is the sample size.
Horizontal lines at \eqn{\pm 2}{+/- 2} mark unusually large residuals.
Point size encodes Cook’s distance (\code{.cooksd}) to cue overall influence.

\emph{Reading the plot}
\itemize{
\item Left band near 0: typical leverage; investigate residual structure with the other plots.
\item Right of \eqn{2p/n} with small residuals: high leverage but not influential.
\item Right of \eqn{2p/n} and beyond \eqn{|2|}{2}: candidates for strong influence.
Check data quality and model form before taking action.
}

\strong{General guidance}
\itemize{
\item Normality mainly affects small‑sample accuracy of p‑values and intervals;
linearity and constant variance affect bias and coverage at any size.
\item Diagnostics prompt investigation; decisions should consider context and
subject‑matter knowledge rather than fixed rules.
