\title{2021 General Social Survey subset}
\format{
A tibble with 2444 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{income}}{\code{double}. Respondent’s \emph{personal} earnings in
\strong{constant 1986 US dollars} (variable \code{REALRINC} in the
original GSS). Zero and negative values were
dropped.}
\item{\code{lincome}}{\code{double}. \code{log10(income)} – a log-scaled
version that is closer to normal and is the recommended dependent
variable for normal-linear models.}
\item{\code{degree}}{\code{factor} with 5 levels
\code{"<HS"}, \code{"HS"}, \code{"JrColl"}, \code{"BA"},
\code{"Grad"}; highest educational credential (GSS variable
\code{DEGREE}).}
\item{\code{sex}}{\code{factor} with levels \code{"Male"}, \code{"Female"}
(GSS \code{SEX}).}
\item{\code{age}}{\code{double}. Age in years (\code{AGE}).}
\item{\code{marital}}{\code{factor}. Marital status with the original GSS
labels (\code{MARITAL}).}
\item{\code{hours}}{\code{double}. Usual weekly hours of work
(\code{HRS1}); missing when not working.}
\item{\code{prestige}}{\code{double}. Occupational prestige score
(\code{PRESTG10}; range 16–86).}
\item{\code{childs}}{\code{double}. Number of children ever had
(\code{CHILDS}).}
\item{\code{fulltime}}{\code{factor} with levels \code{"Full-time"},
\code{"Other"}, derived from \code{WRKSTAT}.  “Full-time” corresponds
to \code{WRKSTAT == 1}.}
}

\description{
A tibble drawn from the 2021 cross-section of the US
General Social Survey (GSS). The data frame keeps just a few variables that
are useful for investing predictors of personal earnings (\code{income}).
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Only respondents with non-missing \code{income}, \code{degree},
\code{sex}, and \code{age} are kept.
\item The original “dbl + lbl” (labelled) SPSS columns were converted
to plain numerics or factors with \code{haven::as_factor()}.
\item Constant-dollar scaling means you can compare earnings across
survey years if you wish; for interpretations in 2021 dollars
multiply by \eqn{270.97 / 109.6 \approx 2.47} (CPI-U ratio).
}

data(gss2021)
# Gender × education on log income
summary(aov(lincome ~ sex * degree, data = gss2021))

# Add age as a covariate (ANCOVA)
summary(aov(lincome ~ sex * degree + age, data = gss2021))
