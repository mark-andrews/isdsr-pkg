\title{Reaction times in a sleep-deprivation study}
\format{
A tibble with 180 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{Reaction}{Numeric. Average reaction time (ms).}
\item{Days}{Numeric. Number of days of sleep deprivation.}
\item{Subject}{Factor. Subject identifier.}
}
}
\source{
Adapted from \pkg{lme4}’s \code{sleepstudy} dataset; provided here as a
tibble for convenience.
}
\usage{
sleepstudy
}
\description{
The average reaction time per day (in milliseconds) for subjects in a sleep
deprivation study. Days 0–1 were adaptation/training (T1/T2), day 2 was
baseline (B); sleep deprivation started after day 2.
}
\details{
These data are from the study described in Belenky et al. (2003), for the
most sleep-deprived group (3 hours time-in-bed) and for the first 10 days of
the study, up to the recovery period. The original analysis modeled speed
\eqn{(1/\text{reaction time})} and treated day as a categorical predictor.

# Basic structure
dplyr::glimpse(sleepstudy)

# Small multiples by subject (if ggplot2 is available)
ggplot2::ggplot(sleepstudy, ggplot2::aes(Days, Reaction)) +

  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Subject) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Days of sleep deprivation",
    y = "Average reaction time (ms)"

# Mixed model (if lme4 is available)
fm1 <- lme4::lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject),
  data = sleepstudy,
  subset = Days >= 2
