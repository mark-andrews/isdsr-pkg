\description{
Data concerning the question "Have you ever taken an illegal
drug?" that was in a 2017 poll of 1300 British young adults. Individual
respondents' data are not available but respondents were grouped into
various demographic groups, including age group and gender. Here, we report
the number of respondents in each combination of gender and age group who
gave each of the 8 possible responses to the question.

\details{
The poll in which this question occurred was conducted between the
27th June and the 5th July 2017. A total of 1300 young adults were
surveyed, all of whom were residents of the Britain (England, Wales, or
Scotland), and whose ages ranged from 16 to 24. The individual respondent
level data were not made available. However, the number of individuals in
various demographic categories, including age, gender, etc., were provided.
In addition, the percentage of individuals in each category that chose each
possible response to the question was provided. For example, the report of
the poll results states that there were 162 males in the 16-18 age group.
It also states that 12\% of respondents in this male 16-18 group responded
to the question with "I have taken illegal drugs occasionally and still
do". If we assume that this entails that 12\% of the 162 individuals in this
group responded in this way, then this is approximately 19 individuals in
this gender and age group who responded this way. It should be noted,
however, that it is not obvious that the count of the number of individuals
in each group who responded in any given way can be obtained simply by
multiplying the reported percentage by the reported total, as we have just
done. The percentages may have been calculated using some weighting
formula. Although it is not explicitly stated that this was done, the
report does provide unweighted as well as weighted totals in each
demographic category, and thus it may be that some weighting was applied to
obtain the reported percentage. Notwithstanding this possibility, here we
report counts for each category and response type obtaining by simply
multiplying the stated unweighted total for each category by the stated
percentage for each possible response.
