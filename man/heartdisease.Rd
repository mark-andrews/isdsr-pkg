\title{Heart Disease (Cleveland) — Reduced Variables}
\format{
A tibble with 303 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{resting_bp}{Numeric.
Resting blood pressure on admission, in mm Hg (original variable: \code{trestbps}).}
\item{angina}{Factor with levels \code{no}, \code{yes}.
Exercise-induced angina (\code{exang}: 0 = no, 1 = yes) recoded to labels.}
\item{heart_disease}{Factor with levels \code{no}, \code{yes}.
Angiographic disease status (\code{num}) recoded to binary:
0 = \code{no}, 1–4 = \code{yes}.}
}
}
\source{
UCI Machine Learning Repository: Heart Disease Data Set (Cleveland subset).
Data accessed via \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease}
and mirrored by Data Science Dojo (\code{processed.cleveland.data}).

\usage{

\description{
A compact version of the UCI Heart Disease (Cleveland) dataset with three variables
for illustrating binary classification and simple modelling.
Each row is a patient assessed for suspected heart disease.
}
\details{
This dataset is derived from the Cleveland subset of the UCI Heart Disease data.
From the original 14 attributes, we retain \code{trestbps}, \code{exang}, and \code{num}.
We rename \code{trestbps} to \code{resting_bp}, recode \code{exang} to the factor \code{angina},
and collapse \code{num} to a binary factor \code{heart_disease} indicating presence of disease.
Missing values coded as \code{"?"} in the source are treated as \code{NA}.
