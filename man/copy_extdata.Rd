\title{Copy a file from \emph{inst/extdata} into the working directory}
\usage{
copy_extdata(filename, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A single character string giving the exact path to the
resource within \emph{inst/extdata}.  Sub-directories are allowed, e.g.
\code{"csv/demo.csv"} or \code{"images/logo.png"}.}

\item{overwrite}{Should an existing target file be replaced?  Defaults to
\code{FALSE}, in which case the function stops rather than overwrite data.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a logical scalar: \code{TRUE} when the copy succeeded
and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  The function is called for its side effect of
writing a file; on success it prints a short message, on failure it raises
an error or warning.
}
\description{
This helper lets users experiment with the small demo files that ship
with \strong{sgsur} (or any other package) without asking them to locate the
installation directory.  It looks for \code{filename} inside the packageâ€™s
\emph{inst/extdata} folder, checks a few safety conditions, then copies the
file to \code{getwd()}.
}
\details{
The call aborts with an informative error when
\itemize{
\item the requested file is not present in \emph{extdata}, or
\item a file of the same name already exists in the working directory and
\code{overwrite = FALSE}.
}
}

\item \code{\link[base:files]{base::file.copy()}} which does the low-level transfer.

\examples{
## copy the example CSV that ships with the package -----------------
tmp <- tempdir()
old <- setwd(tmp)

copy_extdata("survey.csv") # writes survey.csv into tempdir()
readr::read_csv("survey.csv") # inspect its contents

unlink("survey.csv") # clean up
setwd(old)

## overwrite protection --------------------------------------------
copy_extdata("survey.csv") # first copy
copy_extdata("survey.csv", overwrite = TRUE) # replace it silently

}
